# linkedinreach_codesample_usertable

This repository displays the User table on the Administrator dashboard; this table lists users who have created accounts on the Votoxvoto website.

From this table, the administrator can see the user's account information and whether their accounts are currently active. The administrator can also update the user's active status, as needed.

This paginated user table can be filtered based on the user's role type (i.e. 'Campaign', 'Surveyor').
